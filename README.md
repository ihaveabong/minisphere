miniSphere
==========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fatcerberus/minisphere.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fatcerberus/minisphere)

**miniSphere** is the official successor to Chad Austin's original *Sphere*
JavaScript game engine, written from the ground up in C.  Games are coded in
JavaScript, making for a very powerful development platform on par with writing
a game in C++.

The engine uses [Allegro 5](http://liballeg.org) on the backend and
[Duktape](http://duktape.org/) on the frontend.  Both of these libraries are
cross-platform and *very* portable, enabling miniSphere to be built on all
three of the major platforms (Windows, Linux, and OS X).

The Game Engine
---------------

*Sphere* games are written in JavaScript.  The engine exposes a collection of
low-level functions to the JavaScript environment, leaving higher-level game
logic entirely up to script.  In this way, any kind of game you can imagine can
be developed.

The Compiler
------------

**Cell**, miniSphere's compiler, uses JavaScript to control the build process.
Out of the box, the compiler supports ECMAScript 2015 transpilation, allowing
you to use new JavaScript syntax such as classes and arrow functions in your
game.  A basic Cellscript might look like this:

```js
import transpile from 'transpile';

// whatever is passed to describe() is written to game.json.
describe("Game Title",
{
    author: "Some Guy",
    summary: "This game is awesome.",
    resolution: '320x240',
    main: 'scripts/main.js',  // main JS module
});

// miniSphere doesn't support ES 2015 syntax natively.  transpile() builds
// compatible scripts from ES 2015 code.
let sources = files('scripts/*.js', true);
transpile('@/scripts', sources);

// install assets into the game package.
install('@/images', files('images/*.png', true));
install('@/music',  files('music/*.ogg', true));
install('@/sounds', files('sounds/*.wav', true));
install('@/',       files('icon.png'));
```

If that's not enough for you, then using Cell's flexible Tool API, you can
extend the compiler to build any kind of asset.  Simply construct a Tool
object and provide a function which will be called when the tool is executed.
The Tool below will write the contents of a single source file to the
destination file:

```js
// the second argument to `new Tool()` is optional and describes the process
// performed by the tool, e.g., "compiling" or "installing".  if omitted, Cell
// just says "building".
const CopyTool = new Tool((outName, sourceNames) => {
    let buffer = FS.readFile(sourceNames[0]);
    FS.writeFile(outName, buffer);
}, "copying");
```

To instruct Cell to build a file using your new Tool, just do this:

```js
// the first argument is the destination filename, the second argument is an
// array of Target objects specifying the sources.  Here we pass an exact
// filename to files() to get that array.
//
// note: the prefix '@/' refers to the root of the game package being compiled.
//       see `cellscript-api.txt` for more information on SphereFS prefixes.
CopyTool.stage('@/eatypig.fat', files('eaty/pig.src'));
```

The Debugger
------------

**SSj**, included with miniSphere, is an easy-to-use command-line debugger for
*Sphere* games.  SSj allows you to step through your game's code and inspect
the internal state of the game--variables, call stack, objects, etc.--as it
executes.  Best of all, the original source files don't need to be present, as
SSj can download source code directly from the engine instance being debugged.

A symbolic debugger like SSj is an invaluable tool for development and is a
miniSphere exclusive: no such tool was ever available for the original *Sphere*
engine.
